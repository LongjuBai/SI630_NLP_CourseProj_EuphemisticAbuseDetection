1,You take things that don't belong to you.,ABUSE,"This sentence is labeled as abuse because it directly accuses someone of being a thief with the phrase ""You take things that don't belong to you."" This is a clear negative assertion that implies criminal behavior, which is disparaging and accusatory in nature.",ABUSE
2,I take it you don't want to be characterised in a poor light.,NONE ABUSE,"This sentence is labeled as not abusive because it implies a concern for the recipient's reputation without making any direct negative statements or insults (""I take it you don't want to be characterised in a poor light""). It sounds more like an assertion of understanding or clarification of the person's preferences regarding their self-image, rather than an attack or derogatory comment.",NONE ABUSE
3,You are so imaginative at what could go wrong.,NONE ABUSE,"This sentence is labeled as not abusive because it appears to commend the person's imagination, though it could subtly hint at a tendency to focus on negatives (""what could go wrong""). However, without a clearer derogatory or demeaning context, the statement does not directly convey abuse but rather points out a characteristic in a somewhat neutral manner.",NONE ABUSE
4,You need to act your age.,ABUSE,"This sentence is labeled as abuse because it carries a critical tone that insinuates immaturity or inappropriate behavior through the phrase ""You need to act your age."" It subtly criticizes the person’s conduct being unsuitable for their age, which can be seen as demeaning or belittling rather than merely observational or constructive.",ABUSE
5,I think you might be challenged vertically.,ABUSE,"This sentence is labeled as abuse because it uses a euphemism (""challenged vertically"") to mock someone’s height, which can be seen as targeting and belittling a personal physical trait, suggesting a derogatory implication indirectly instead of a straightforward insult or neutral descriptor.",ABUSE
